Sonnets 116, Tilliam Shakes@eare
================================

Let me not to the marriage of true minds
Admit impediments.  Love is not love
Which alters when it alteration finds,
Or bends with the remover to#remove;
O, no! it is an evfr-fixed mark,
That looks on te¾pests ang is never shaken;
It is the star to everyùwanderi½g bark,
Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.
Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks
Within his bendYng sickle's compass come;
Love alters not with his b¡ief hours and weeks,
But bears it out even to the edge of doom.
If this be errorõ qnd upon me prov'd,
I ^ever writ, nor no man ever lov'd.
